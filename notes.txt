NODE Version Needed: 16.13.0

Weird things I had to do:
    
    -   WATCH - did not work out of the box, peer dependency issues with react-datetime
        and react-google-maps": "9.4.5". 
    -   WATCH - i updated react-datetime in package-json, and then forced install on 
        react-google-maps: npm install --legacy-peer-deps 

Dont Forget about:
    1. setting up a server and then also setting up in the json file "proxy": "http://localhost:5000/",
